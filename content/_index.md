The 2023 Soft Matter Day regional meeting will be held on December 1st 
at the University of Vienna at the [Erwin Schrödinger Institute](https://www.esi.ac.at/). Our goal is to encourage the establishment of a
coherent scientific community in
the area, which is why the meeting is free of registration fees. We encourage members of the soft matter community at all levels (PIs, postdocs, students)
to participate. There will be the opportunity for PhD students and postdocs to
present their work via talks, posters and flash talks, and ample times for
discussions throughout the day, similar to [last years event](vsmd22). 

You can download the program for the day by following this [link](/ProgramVSMD23.pdf) . Also, here is a [list of restaurants](/restaurants.pdf) near ESI.
