The upcoming **2024 Soft Matter Day** will be a day-long event held on **15th of November 2024**, in the 
“TUthe Sky” lecture hall at **Getreidemarkt 9** in Vienna followed by an informal wine and cheese. 
Our goal is to encourage the establishment of a coherent scientific community in the area, which is why the meeting is free of registration fees. 
We encourage members of the soft matter community at all levels (PIs, postdocs, students) to participate.

You can sign up [here](https://forms.gle/xyVuYfijzsntn3dP9)!

There will be the opportunity for PhD students and postdocs to present their work via talks, posters and flash talks, and ample times for discussions throughout the day, similar to [last years event](vsmd23) and [the one before](vsmd22). 

If you have questions, comments, or problems with the registration, please contact one of the organisers:
