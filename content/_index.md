The 2023 Soft Matter Day regional meeting will be held on December 1st 
at [ESI](https://esi.ac.at). Our goal is to encourage the establishment of a
coherent scientific community in
the area, which is why the meeting is free of registration fees. There will be
the opportunity for PhD students and postdocs to present their work via Postares
and talks and ample times for discussions throughout the day.

The soft matter day is a joint effort of members of several regional
research institutions:

IST Austria
University of Vienna
TU Wien
BOKU
