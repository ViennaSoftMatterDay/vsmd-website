The 2024 Soft Matter Day regional meeting will be held on the 15th of November 2024 at the [Technical University of Vienna](https://www.tuwien.at/).
Our goal is to encourage the establishment of a coherent scientific community in the area, which is why the meeting is free of registration fees. 
We encourage members of the soft matter community at all levels (PIs, postdocs, students) to participate. 

There will be the opportunity for PhD students and postdocs to present their work via talks, posters and flash talks, and ample times for discussions throughout the day, similar to [last years event](vsmd23) and [the one before](vsmd22).
