The 2023 Soft Matter Day regional meeting will be held on December 1st 
at the [Erwin Schršdinger Institute](https://www.esi.ac.at/). Our goal is to encourage the establishment of a
coherent scientific community in
the area, which is why the meeting is free of registration fees. There will be
the opportunity for PhD students and postdocs to present their work via Postares
and talks and ample times for discussions throughout the day.

Register via the [signup form](https://forms.gle/t31yk89tL9xEsjy69) until October 1st 2023.
